# The aim of this project is to use Tensorflow to process our data.
#   - input_train_val_split: read in data; split data into training sets and validation sets; generate batches
#   - model: build the model architecture
#   - train_and_val: train and validate
# use Python 3.5, Tensorflow 1.3, cuda 8.0
# gpu gt750m

# data: cats vs. dogs from Kaggle
# Download link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data
# data size: {train set: 544MB, 25000 images; test set: 271MB,12500 images}

# How to run?
# 1. run the train_and_val.py once
# 2. call the run_training() in the console to train the model

# Note:
# restart your kenel to train the model multiple times
# in order to clear all the variables in memory
# otherwise errors may occur, e.g.:conv1/weights/bias already exist
